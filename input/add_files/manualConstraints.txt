## format GO <tab> desc go <tab> namespace <tab> taxid <tab> name of taxon <tab> constraint -> can be "Never in taxon" or "in taxon"
##                                    WARNING !!!! READ CAREFULLY !!!!
## "in taxon" is different from "only in taxon" because it means that the GO and its sons can be used for that taxon
## and are not exclusively used in that taxon. No assumptions are made for other taxa.
## both "Never in taxon" and "in taxon" of this file overrule other constraints !!!!
