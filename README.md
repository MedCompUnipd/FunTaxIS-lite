# FunTaxIS-lite
FunTaxIS-lite is a faster version of the [FunTaxIS](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31971) algorithm. FunTaxIS considers Gene Ontology (GO) terms and their frequencies found in the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database. Since annotations are linked to proteins and species, the frequencies of GO terms can be associated with the species (identified by an ID) which the proteins belong to. This association between GO terms and taxonomic ID is exploited to infer which terms are allowed or forbidden for annotating proteins of a particular species, providing a set of constraints between them.
## Dependencies
The required dependencies, to successfully run FunTaxIS-lite, are the following:

* C/C++ compiler
* [Cython](https://pypi.org/project/Cython/)
* [Owlready2](https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/)
* [argparse](https://pypi.org/project/argparse/)



Optional dependence is the following:

 * [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

The Beautiful Soup library is used to automatically get the new taxonomic ID when an ID writes in the taxonConstraintsDef.txt file is not found in the tree. Otherwise a warning is thrown.

## Usage

Allow all permission (rwx) on src folder before running FunTaxIS-lite by typing the following command:
   <br><sup> chmod -R 777 src/ </sup><br>
<br> FunTaxIS-lite can be run in two ways:

1.  Using one script.
2.  Using a specific step scripts.

To use FunTaxIS-lite with one script run the `run.sh` script as follow:

    ./run.sh <config-file>

the script downloads the required files (if necessary), generates the taxonomic constraints for each species found in the selected databases and computes the taxonomic constraints for the user-selected species.

To use FunTaxIS-lite with a specific step script run the script as follow:

    ./download.sh <config-file>

    ./generate_all_taxon_constraints.sh <config-file>

    ./generate_species_taxon_constraints.sh <config-file>

Where

- `download.sh` downloads the latest release of all the files required by FunTaxIS-lite, if the user not specify the required file paths or the files are not found.
- `generate_all_taxon_constraints.sh` generates all the taxonomic constraints for the species that have at least one annotation (if the GOA is used) or a taxonomic constraint is defined (if the consortium data is used). The script can be run if the GO, GOA, and taxonomy data exist.
- `generate_species_taxon_constraints.sh` generates the taxonomic constraints of a list of user-selected species. It can be run either after the `generate_all_taxon_constraints.sh` script or if the required intermediate files exist.
- `config-file` is the configuration file. (`config_file.cfg` in this repository.)

The `launcher.sh` is used inside the container to correctly run one of the above scripts.

The configuration file contains the following parameters:

- `folder`: the folder containing all the required files to correctly run FunTaxIS-lite and the intermediate files generated by FunTaxIS-lite. (Mandatory.)
- `go`: the GO graph file path. The file must be in OWL format and the PLUS version. Without the parameter the script downloads the latest release of the Gene Ontology graph. (Optional. Default: GO's latest release.)
- `goa`: the GOA file path. The file must be in GAF format. Without the parameter the script downloads the latest release of the Gene Ontology Annotation. (Optional. Default: GOA's latest release.)
- `taxonomy`: the NCBI's taxonomy taxdump folder. Without the parameter the script downloads the latest release of the NCBI's taxonomy tree. (Optional. Default: Taxonomy's latest release.)
- `taxon-def`: the taxonomy nodes ID list at species level and above used to define the taxonomic constraints. Without the parameter the script uses the taxonConstraintDef.txt file in add_files folder. (Optional. Default: use the taxonomy definition file in add_files folder.)
- `species`: the list of species of interest. Without the parameter the script uses the species.txt file in add_files folder. (Optional. Default: use the species file in add_files directory.)
- `manual-constraints`: list of specific constraints that overrule the existing constraints. Without the parameter the script uses the manualConstraints.txt file in add_files folder. (Optional. Default: use the manual constratins file in add_files folder.)
- `cutoff`: the GO's frequency threshold used to define constraints. (Optional. Default: 500)
- `debug`: if true, maintains the intermediary files. Allowed values are `true`, `t`, `false`, and `f`. (Optional. Default: false.)
- `type`: the type of taxonomic constraints generated. Allowed values are `automatic`, `auto`, `a`, `manual`, `man`, and `m`. (Optional. Default: manual and automatic.)
- `results`: the output files folder. (Mandatory.)

## Containers

In the `containers` folder contains the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) definition files.

To build the container use one of the following commands (with root permission) inside the FunTaxIS-lite folder:

    docker build -t <image_name> -f <dockerfile_path>

or

    singularity build -F <image_name> <definition_file_path>

for Docker and Singularity respectively.

After the container is builted, the container can be used with one of the following commands:

    docker run <image_name> [options] <config_file_path>

or

    singularity run <image_name> [options] <config_file_path>

The available options are the following:
* `-a`: to generate the taxonomic constraints of all the species found in the input data.
* `-d`: to download all the necessary data to correctly run FunTaxIS-lite.
* `-f`: to use the complete FunTaxIS pipeline.
* `-s`: to generate the taxonomic constraints of the species chosen by the user.
